---

## Task 1: Defining Your Problem and Audience

### 1.1 Problem Statement (1 sentence)
**I am solving the problem of inefficient and generic career guidance for AI/ML professionals who currently struggle to get personalized, data-driven advice for their specific career situations and rapidly evolving industry demands.**

### 1.2 Problem Context (1-2 paragraphs)
AI/ML professionals face unique career challenges in one of the fastest-evolving industries. Unlike traditional software engineering, AI careers span diverse specializations (ML Engineering, Data Science, AI Research, MLOps) with rapidly changing skill requirements, compensation structures, and interview processes. Current career resources are either too generic (general tech career advice), quickly outdated (static salary surveys from 6+ months ago), or don't understand the nuances between different AI roles and career paths.

Existing solutions like LinkedIn Career Advice, Glassdoor, or generic career coaches fall short because they lack real-time AI job market data, don't understand technical role distinctions, and provide one-size-fits-all guidance. This creates a significant gap where AI professionals need specialized, current advice about salary negotiations, interview preparation for specific companies, skill development roadmaps, and career transition strategies, but cannot access personalized, data-backed recommendations that understand their technical background and career goals.

### 1.3 User Profile and Questions
**Primary User Profile:**
- **Job Titles:** ML Engineer, AI Engineer, Data Scientist, AI Researcher, MLOps Engineer
- **Experience Level:** Mid-level professionals (2-5 years experience) looking to make strategic career moves
- **Primary Responsibilities:** Building ML models, deploying AI systems, conducting research, optimizing ML infrastructure
- **Career Function Being Automated:** Research and synthesis of career market intelligence, personalized advice generation

**Typical Questions Users Ask:**
1. "What's the average salary for an ML Engineer with 3 years experience in San Francisco?"
2. "How do I prepare for Google's AI engineer interview process?"
3. "What skills do I need to transition from Software Engineer to ML Engineer?"
4. "How should I negotiate a senior AI researcher offer at a startup vs FAANG?"
5. "What certifications are most valuable for AI engineers in 2025?"
6. "Which companies are hiring for MLOps roles and what do they pay?"
7. "How do I build a portfolio for transitioning into AI research?"
8. "What's the career progression path from Data Scientist to ML Engineering Manager?"
9. "Should I specialize in computer vision or NLP for better career prospects?"
10. "How do I evaluate equity compensation at AI startups?"

---

## Task 2: Propose a Solution

### 2.1 Solution Description (1-2 paragraphs)
The AI Career Coach is an intelligent conversational assistant that provides personalized, data-driven career guidance specifically for AI/ML professionals. Users interact through natural conversation, asking questions about salaries, career paths, interview preparation, or skill development. The system combines a comprehensive job market database (15,000+ AI positions) with real-time web search capabilities to deliver actionable insights tailored to each user's specific situation, experience level, and career goals.

In this better world, AI professionals save 10+ hours per week on career research by getting instant access to curated, relevant information. Instead of manually scouring multiple job boards, salary sites, and forums, they receive personalized responses like "Based on 1,200 similar ML Engineer positions, expect $165-195K base salary in SF with your background, plus equity typically 0.1-0.3%. Here's a step-by-step negotiation strategy and email template." Users make better career decisions with data-backed confidence, negotiate higher compensation (average 15-25% increase), and accelerate their career progression through targeted skill development recommendations.

### 2.2 Technology Stack Decisions

### 3.2 Chunking Strategy
**Chunking Strategy:** RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with hierarchical splitting
**Chunk Size:** 1000 characters  
**Overlap:** 200 characters  
**Separators:** ["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""] in priority order

**Rationale:** This approach works optimally for job market data because:
1. **1000 character chunks** capture complete job descriptions while staying within context windows
2. **200 character overlap** ensures important details spanning chunk boundaries aren't lost (crucial for salary ranges and requirements)
3. **Hierarchical separators** respect natural document structure, keeping related job details together
4. **Paragraph-first splitting** maintains coherent information blocks about specific roles or companies

### 3.3 Additional Data Requirements
**Data Preprocessing:**
- **CSV Cleaning**: Standardize salary formats, normalize job titles, handle missing values with "Not specified"
- **Duplicate Removal**: Deduplication based on company + job_title + location to avoid skewed salary data
- **Data Validation**: Filter out incomplete records missing critical fields (salary, location, experience_level)

**Data Update Strategy:**
- **Static Phase**: Currently using fixed dataset for consistent evaluation and development
- **Future Dynamic Updates**: Plan for weekly batch updates with new job postings to maintain relevance
- **Version Control**: Track data versions for reproducible evaluation results

**Specialized Data Needs:**
- **Confidence Scoring**: Custom metadata tracking document relevance scores for threshold-based fallback decisions
- **Query Classification**: Preprocessing career-specific keywords for intelligent routing to appropriate data sources
