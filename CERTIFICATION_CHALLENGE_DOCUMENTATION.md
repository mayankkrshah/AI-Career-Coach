## Task 1: Defining Your Problem and Audience

### 1.1 Problem Statement (1 sentence)
**I am solving the problem of inefficient and generic career guidance for AI/ML professionals who currently struggle to get personalized, data-driven advice for their specific career situations and rapidly evolving industry demands.**

### 1.2 Problem Context (1-2 paragraphs)
AI/ML professionals face unique career challenges in one of the fastest-evolving industries. Unlike traditional software engineering, AI careers span diverse specializations (ML Engineering, Data Science, AI Research, MLOps) with rapidly changing skill requirements, compensation structures, and interview processes. Current career resources are either too generic (general tech career advice), quickly outdated (static salary surveys from 6+ months ago), or don't understand the nuances between different AI roles and career paths.

Existing solutions like LinkedIn Career Advice, Glassdoor, or generic career coaches fall short because they lack real-time AI job market data, don't understand technical role distinctions, and provide one-size-fits-all guidance. This creates a significant gap where AI professionals need specialized, current advice about salary negotiations, interview preparation for specific companies, skill development roadmaps, and career transition strategies, but cannot access personalized, data-backed recommendations that understand their technical background and career goals.

### 1.3 User Profile and Questions

## Task 2: Propose a Solution

### 2.1 Solution Description (1-2 paragraphs)
The AI Career Coach is an intelligent conversational assistant that provides personalized, data-driven career guidance specifically for AI/ML professionals. Users interact through natural conversation, asking questions about salaries, career paths, interview preparation, or skill development. The system combines a comprehensive job market database (15,000+ AI positions) with real-time web search capabilities to deliver actionable insights tailored to each user's specific situation, experience level, and career goals.

In this better world, AI professionals save 10+ hours per week on career research by getting instant access to curated, relevant information. Instead of manually scouring multiple job boards, salary sites, and forums, they receive personalized responses like "Based on 1,200 similar ML Engineer positions, expect $165-195K base salary in SF with your background, plus equity typically 0.1-0.3%. Here's a step-by-step negotiation strategy and email template." Users make better career decisions with data-backed confidence, negotiate higher compensation (average 15-25% increase), and accelerate their career progression through targeted skill development recommendations.
